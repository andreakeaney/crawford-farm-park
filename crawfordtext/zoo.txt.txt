PETTING ZOO
Throughout the year we always have a variety of fluffy animals to handle during our Animal Handling Sessions. We have rabbits, guinea pigs, chicks and ducklings. Animal petting sessions are held throughout the day and supervised by one of our members of staff.

We also have a large display of chickens, geese, turkeys and ducks! (These are not so keen on being handled but love to be fed)!

PADDOCKS AND FARM ANIMALS
We are a family working farm and have many varieties of cows, sheep, pigs and goats. (Too many to mention here)! You will find all of these animals around the farm and walks, with great opportunities to get up close and personal!
