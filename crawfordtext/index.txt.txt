Crawford Farm Park is an award winning farm park where children and adults of all ages can have hands on experiences of farm and country life. There are so many opportunities to explore the whole farm; the shop, the walks, the petting zoo, the playpark and the cafe.

Visitors can also handle the rabbits, chicks and guinea pigs in the petting zoo and watch the very popular piglet race or play in the adventure playground. We are open every day of the year apart from the period between Christmas and New Year – allowing visitors to enjoy lots of different farm experiences such as lambing, sheep shearing and harvest time on the farm.

Rain never stops the fun at Crawford… We have a huge timber play adventure barn and all of the animal activities take place undercover so you can enjoy it all – whatever the weather!

Our walks will take you on all sorts of adventures!

There are plenty of places to eat and picnic. The Cafe offers full table service, including delicious coffee and sandwiches! Picnic benches are situated all around the site.

Well behaved dogs on leads with responsible owners are welcome.

We look foward to seeing you soon!
